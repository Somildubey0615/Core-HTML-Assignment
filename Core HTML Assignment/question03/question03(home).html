        <br> <br> i want to be a full stack developer and yes i know its a long journey with unexpected challenges we have to be more punctual and consistent. i am ready and super exited to move ahead and reaching to my destination it vwill be more fun and exiting. its not all about coding and coding its about ur creativity thought process. if coding and writing syntax could be everything then wy we need to human or developer so point is clear there is more value of creativity and problem solving. <br><br> so for now see you everyone thank you so moch for this opportunity to share my personal experience. and please ignore my grammatical mistakes i am learning day by day.
